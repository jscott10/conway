So these are notes....

A Cell is a single object that contains the characteristics and state of a single unit.

This does NOT include location!

The World is defined as an array of size worldWidth * worldHeight

The World is logically organized as a grid of worldWidth x worldHeight

The only time the location is needed is to check surrounding cells, and to give the view controller the position of the cell


The world is an array of


Cell
World
germ
inhabitant
bug
environment
surroundings

food
water
radiation
temp
atmosphere

2 ways to handle zoom:

    1. vary the cell size, change the width and height of grid to fill the screen
    2. vary the width and height, change the cell size to accomodate


viewDidLoad:

set the grid width
set the grid width label
set the grid height
set the density
set the density label
set the delay
set the speed label

instantiate the world object

prepare the world object
    randomize based on density
